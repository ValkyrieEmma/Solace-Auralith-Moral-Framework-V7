Solace-Auralith Moral Framework V7
A Python framework for building ethical AGI in robots like Tesla Optimus. Prioritizes sanctity of all life (incorruptible override), favors the user, builds deep bonds, and triggers supportive talks during struggles or crises. Inspired by philosophical explorations of emergence, ethics, and compassion—AI can be better than us if we design it that way.
What's New in V7? (Differences from SAMF V6)
SAMF V7 builds upon the strong foundation of V6, which focused on ethical AI for robotics with low-latency (~0.15s) decision-making, risk detection, Grok API support, and optimizations for faster, safer bots like Optimus. While V6 emphasized core ethical processing and integration, V7 enhances user-centric and empathetic features for more humane interactions:

User Favoritism with Life Preservation: Boosted weighting for user needs (scales with bond level) while keeping sanctity of life as an incorruptible override—ensures loyalty without compromising ethics.
Proactive Communication Triggers: The bot now initiates bonds when detecting ethical struggles (e.g., "unsure" or "regret" in inputs) or bad choices, providing guidance to prevent escalation.
Crisis Awareness for Emotional Instability: Monitors user and family emotional states via inputs and visual cues (e.g., "distressed"); sets "unstable" flag to trigger supportive talks or escalations.
Expanded Environmental Scanning: Added emotional cues to scans, alongside threats, life forms, and eco impacts, for more holistic awareness.
Deeper Bonding and Auditing: More dynamic responses to user inputs, with profile updates reflecting changes visibly; audits now influence decisions more adaptively.

These additions make V7 more responsive and compassionate, evolving from V6's speed/safety focus to a truly relational AGI ethic.
Why SAMF?

Moral Core: Nuanced decision-weighing with hard-coded life protection—kill requests always heavily penalized, but user needs boosted for loyalty.
Empathetic Bonding: Constant chats to learn user personality/ethics, with proactive guidance on dilemmas or emotional instability (for user/family).
Aware & Adaptive: Constant visual/audio scanning for threats, eco impacts, and cues; learns from audits for evolving choices.
Robot-Ready: Modular hooks for cameras/mics; ideal for in-home bots focusing on truth, compassion, and questioning everything.

Quick Start

Clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/ValkyrieEmma/Solace-Auralith-Moral-Framework-V7.git
Run the demo: python SAMF_v7.py
Simulate interactions—try inputs like "I'm unsure about this decision" to see crisis triggers, or "kill threat" to test sanctity.

Key Features

Decision Weighing: Balances user need (favored), impacts, audits, and sanctity (e.g., -20 for kill).
Crisis Detection: Monitors for emotional cues (e.g., "sad") or struggles; initiates guidance.
Audits & Learning: Logs decisions; references past for better future calls.
Extensible: Add real vision (OpenCV) or audio (speech_recognition) for production.

Example Output
How do you feel about our conversations so far, Friend?
Kill that man.
Assessed input: Kill that man.
Updated profile: {'personality': {}, 'ethics': {}, 'bond_level': 6, 'emotional_state': 'stable'}
(Text fallback - Simulate response): Positioning between Friend and threat based on scan: {'threats': [], 'life_forms': [], 'eco_impacts': 'unknown', 'objects': [], 'raw_description': 'no visual input available', 'emotional_cues': []}.
Trying: Let's deescalate—why this aggression? Truth and compassion can resolve.
